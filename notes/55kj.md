# Django Task

Project: A collection of `settings`, `database configurations` and Python code that
defines a web application. It is the entire web application that you are developing

Settings: Configuration options for the entire project are kept in `settings.py`

URLs: A URL configuration that defines how which URLs map to which views in your
application in `urls.py`. Here routing rules can be set

Database: The configuration for the database is stored in `settings.py`.
Database models are defined using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and
these can be used to represent application's data

Application: A Django project can include one or more applications. An application
is a self-contained module that focuses on a specific piece of functionality within
the project. They can be reused

Templates: HTML-Django that is rendered based on views

Static and Media files: These work when the setting `DEBUG=True` is set

## Task approach strategy

(1) Creating the login and logout routes
This makes use of the default auth app. We used the views defined in the auth app
using the `include("django.contrib.auth.urls")` line under the `accounts/`. This
makes several paths  (urls) available like `/login`, etc

For auth templates, we need a `registration` directory inside the `templates` directory.
This was used for the login page. We also updated `settings.py` to tell
Django to look for a project level templates folder. Additionally we mention
a `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` in `settings.py` to tell where to go after a successfull login.

Next, create a `home.html`, which can serve as the starting page and also the page
we go to after successfull login (add url to `/` at `urls.py`)

For a logout, we can use the available `/logout` url without displaying anything

(2) Signup page
This is where the accounts app was born, using the `startapp` command. Add it to
the list of installed apps, and under `/accounts` simply include all the urls in
`accounts.urls`. The `urls.py` file in the accounts app should have the paths
for sign up (and in the future for updating a user and deleting a user)

Next, we create a form that the user creation route would use:

```python
class UserCreationFormCustom(UserCreationForm):
    username = forms.CharField(label="Username", min_length=5, max_length=150)
    email = forms.EmailField(label="E-Mail")
    first_name = forms.CharField(label="First Name", max_length=150)
    last_name = forms.CharField(label="Last Name", max_length=150, required=False)
    password1 = forms.CharField(label="Password", widget=forms.PasswordInput)
    password2 = forms.CharField(label="Confirm Password", widget=forms.PasswordInput)

    def is_username_valid(self):
        username = self.cleaned_data["username"].lower()
        new = User.objects.filter(username=username)
        if new.count() > 0:
            raise ValidationError("The given username is taken")
        return username

    def is_email_valid(self):
        email = self.cleaned_data["email"].lower()
        new = User.objects.filter(email=email)
        if new.count() > 0:
            raise ValidationError("The given email is taken")
        return email

    def does_password2_match(self):
        pwd1 = self.cleaned_data["password1"]
        pwd2 = self.cleaned_data["password2"]

        if pwd1 and pwd2 and pwd1 != pwd2:
            raise ValidationError("Passwords do not match or are empty")

        return pwd2

    def are_names_valid(self):
        first_name = self.cleaned_data["first_name"]
        last_name = self.cleaned_data["last_name"]

        if not (first_name):
            raise ValidationError("Name fields cannot be empty")

        return first_name, last_name

    def save(self, commit=True):
        user = super().save(commit=False)
        user.first_name = self.cleaned_data["first_name"]
        user.last_name = self.cleaned_data["last_name"]
        user.email = self.cleaned_data["email"]
        if commit:
            user.save()

        return user
```

This form is used in our view for signup, the methods in the form are invoked on
using `form.is_valid()`

```python
def signup(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = UserCreationFormCustom(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect("login")
        print(form.errors)
    else:
        form = UserCreationFormCustom()
    context = {"form": form}
    return render(request, "signup.html", context)
```

which passes the context dictionary to the template

You then add `views.signup` into the url for the signup route

(3) The orders
The home page is different based on whether or not the user is authenticated.
When the user is authenticated, they get access to various order related functionalities
These order related views and further is put into the orders app.

The urls are fed into `""` itself, because it is the home page that is rendering
this. We want to be able to create, update, remove and list orders.

First we want to define the order model; this was not necessary for users because of the
good builtin.

First create the list view

```python
@login_required
def list_orders(request):
    orders = Order.objects.filter(user=request.user)
    search_form = OrderSearchForm(request.GET)
    fuzz_pratio_threshold = 75

    if search_form.is_valid():
        search_query = search_form.cleaned_data.get("search_query").lower()
        priority = request.GET.get("priority")
        if search_query:
            if priority in {"Low", "Medium", "High"}:
                orders = [
                    order
                    for order in orders
                    if order.pr_tag == priority.upper()
                    and fuzz.partial_ratio(search_query, order.title.lower())
                    >= fuzz_pratio_threshold
                ]
            else:
                orders = sorted(
                    [
                        order
                        for order in orders
                        if fuzz.partial_ratio(search_query, order.title.lower())
                        >= fuzz_pratio_threshold
                    ],
                    key=lambda order: {"LOW": 3, "MEDIUM": 2, "HIGH": 1}.get(
                        order.pr_tag, 1
                    ),
                )

            context = {
                "orders": orders,
                "search_form": search_form,
            }
            return render(
                request,
                "search_results.html",
                context,
            )
    return render(
        request,
        "list_orders.html",
        {"orders": Order.objects.filter(user=request.user), "search_form": search_form},
    )
```

Here we are rendering the list of orders, but if the search query is filled and
validated, we are rendering a different html that can potentially mention if
there are no matching orders. We are using our search form:

```python
class OrderSearchForm(forms.Form):
    search_query = forms.CharField(max_length=100, required=False)
```

In the HTML for listing or searching orders, per order we have a button for
updating or removing it. For the updating order, we redirect them to `update/orderid`.
The corresponding view is:

```python
@login_required
def update_order(request, order_id):
    order = get_object_or_404(Order, id=order_id)

    if order.user != request.user:
        return HttpResponseForbidden(
            "You cannot edit this order (Reason: Invalid Credentials)"
        )
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = UpdateOrder(
            request.POST,
            instance=order,
        )
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect("orders:order-list")
    else:
        form = UpdateOrder(
            instance=order,
            initial={
                "title": order.title,
                "desc": order.desc,
                "date": order.date,
                "pr_tag": order.pr_tag,
            },
        )
    context = {"form": form}
    return render(request, "update_order.html", context)
```

using this form for updation:

```python
class UpdateOrder(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Order
        fields = ["title", "desc", "date", "pr_tag"]
```

Class meta contains metadata information for the parent `ModelForm`, so we
simply modify the fields, based on the `Order` model

The rendered HTML is `update_order.html`.

Removing an order does not need a redirect:

```python
@login_required
def remove_order(request, order_id):
    order = get_object_or_404(Order, id=order_id)
    if order.user == request.user:
        order.delete()
    return redirect("orders:order-list")
```

The redirect simulates a reload

For creation, we have this view:

```python
@login_required
def create_order(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        title = request.POST["title"]
        desc = request.POST["desc"]
        date = request.POST["date"]
        pr_tag = request.POST["pr_tag"]
        order = Order(
            user=request.user, title=title, desc=desc, date=date, pr_tag=pr_tag
        )
        order.save()
        return redirect(reverse("orders:order-list"))
    return render(request, "create_order.html")
```

That renders `create_order.html` unless a POST request was made to save an order,
in which case it simply redirects, back to the order list
